Caravan Insurance Policy Prediction • Objective: Developed a predictive model to determine whether a customer is likely to purchase a caravan insurance policy based on 86 features, including product usage and sociodemographic data. • Data: Utilized a dataset of 5,000+ customer records for training and 4,000 customer records for testing, with the target variable indicating whether a customer holds a caravan insurance policy (binary classification: 0/1). • Modeling: Applied various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to train the model, optimizing for accuracy and precision. • Outcome: Predicted the likelihood of customers purchasing a policy, providing actionable insights to reduce marketing waste and improve targeted direct mailing campaigns. • Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliable predictions. • Deliverable: Predicted customer outcomes and submitted predictions in a CSV format for use in targeted marketing.
